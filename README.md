# Decentralized Exchange made with Solidity 

<img alt="WZDM Blockchain DEX" src="https://romantic-agnesi-5db578.netlify.app/wzdm/blockchaindex.png" /> 

## Description

This is a multi-chain Decentralized Exchange template, deployed on the Polygon Network. The index.html page is a landing page template to promote the DEX. There are two different versions of a DEX in this repository. 

[Version 1]
<br />
[Version 2]

Version 1 was created by me during a Decentralized Exchange Course. 

## How it's built

### Data
A majority of the website's page content is stored in the /data/ directory in HTML or MD files. I started with HTML but soon decided that Markdown would be more future proof as it could easily be ported between websites without much work. It allows also the viewing of the content on GitHub in a pretty way.

## Available for sale
